# Description

## Overview
This project implements an image compression algorithm based on Huffman coding, designed to reduce the file size of images while maintaining visual quality. The script effectively encodes image data, optimizing storage and transmission efficiency.

# Features

- **Lossless Compression**: Utilizes Huffman coding to achieve efficient lossless compression of various image formats, ensuring no quality loss during the compression process.
- **Support for Multiple Formats**: Capable of handling popular image formats such as JPEG, PNG, and BMP, providing flexibility for different use cases.
- **Visual Comparison**: Includes functionality to compare original and compressed images, allowing users to assess compression effectiveness visually.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Allows users to adjust parameters such as compression level, enabling fine-tuning based on specific needs.
